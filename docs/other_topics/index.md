# Introduction

This section brings together a series of complementary contents that, while directly
related to the central topics of the course, have not been formally included in the main
structure due to time and teaching planning limitations. Despite this, they are
considered matters of special theoretical and practical relevance, or areas that arouse
particular interest from the professor's point of view, and that can significantly enrich
the overall understanding of deep learning and its foundations.

The purpose of this material is to offer an additional path to delve deeper into aspects
that, in many cases, constitute the conceptual background of the techniques seen in the
course, or represent recent development lines and current trends in the field. It is,
therefore, a natural extension of the official content, aimed at those who wish to go
beyond the bare minimum and explore advanced or less common topics in introductory
courses.

It is possible that, in future program revisions, part of these contents will be
explicitly integrated into the main syllabus. However, at the present time they are
presented as optional modules, organized by topics or subtopics, which students can
consult autonomously according to their interests, learning pace, and specific needs.

It is recommended to review the index of these additional sections and explore those
topics that are of special interest, whether for their practical application, their
conceptual relevance, or their connection with personal or professional projects. In case
questions arise about the content, its level of currency, or its fit within the course,
it is advisable to contact the professor, who can provide guidance on which materials are
most appropriate in each case and how to integrate them into the individual study plan.
