# Introduction

This initial block is conceived as a **conceptual starting point** for all the content
developed throughout the course. Its purpose is to provide a solid foundation on the
technical and structural elements that will be used recurrently in subsequent lessons,
before delving into the mathematical foundations of deep learning and the detailed
analysis of models and algorithms.

First, the functioning of **Python environments** is addressed, focusing on the most
common methods for their creation and on the modern tools available for dependency
management. It analyzes how to configure reproducible and maintainable environments over
time, as well as the importance of efficient package management to avoid dependency
conflicts. This approach is especially relevant when thinking about the transition from
an experimental project to a production environment, where stability, traceability, and
professionalization of the workflow take on a central role.

Next, the **basic data structures of Python** are reviewed, not as isolated concepts, but
as transversal elements that appear constantly in the development of Machine Learning and
Deep Learning applications. Although these structures may have been studied previously in
other courses or with other instructors, they are revisited here with the aim of
consolidating their understanding and analyzing their specific use within the Python
language. It is emphasized that, while many of these structures are common to different
programming languages, Python becomes the main focus as it is the predominant language in
machine learning and deep learning libraries.

The treatment of these data structures is accompanied by simple usage examples that
illustrate their basic functioning. However, it is stressed that this block has an
eminently formative and progressive character, in which learning is reinforced through
direct experimentation. It is the student's responsibility to execute the examples,
modify them, and explore variations, as this active process is key to consolidating the
theoretical concepts presented.

Once this foundation is established, the concept of **tensor** is introduced, understood
as the fundamental data structure on which deep learning libraries operate. Tensors
represent the way data is organized and processed internally, especially when working
with hardware accelerators such as GPUs. This transition from basic data structures to
tensors allows understanding how initial concepts evolve toward more abstract and
efficient models of representation and computation.

Finally, the block is completed with an introduction to the use of **Python libraries**,
their installation, and their integration within properly managed environments. It
explains how to avoid dependency conflicts and how to apply good design practices to
create sustainable code. In this context, the creation of a **custom library** is also
proposed, applying the concepts learned about data structures and object-oriented
programming. This approach allows understanding how machine learning libraries are
designed internally, based on class hierarchies, inheritance, and functionality reuse,
and provides a deeper view of how the Python ecosystem works at a professional level.
