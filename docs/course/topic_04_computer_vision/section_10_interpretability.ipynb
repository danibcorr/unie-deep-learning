    "Challenges of CNN Interpretability \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks, due to their depth and non-linear structure, present significant challenges for interpretability. Understanding how and why a network makes specific predictions is complicated by the large number of parameters and hierarchical feature representations. One approach to probing CNN behavior involves optimizing input images to maximally activate individual neurons, revealing the specific patterns, such as curves, textures, or color arrangements, that a filter is sensitive to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explainability Techniques \n",
    "\n",
    "Several techniques have been developed to provide more systematic interpretability of CNN predictions. Saliency maps compute the gradient of the network output with respect to input pixels, highlighting regions of the input that most strongly influence the model’s decision. Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) generates class-specific heatmaps by weighting feature maps according to their contribution to a particular class, providing spatial insight into which regions drive the prediction. Occlusion analysis is another approach, where portions of the input are systematically masked to observe the effect on output, revealing areas critical to the model’s focus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Application \n",
    "\n",
    "By visualizing the features that influence predictions, practitioners can detect spurious correlations, such as models relying on irrelevant background patterns instead of the actual objects of interest. These insights enable model debugging, refinement, and the development of more robust architectures aligned with domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their utility, explainability methods are often approximate and can produce misleading or unstable visualizations. Interpretations may vary with small perturbations to the input or network parameters, and the results should be considered as qualitative guidance rather than definitive explanations.\n"
